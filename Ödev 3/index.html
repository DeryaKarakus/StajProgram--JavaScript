            <h4>Method</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the shrimp:</li>
                <p>In a medium bowl whisk together the soy sauce, seasoned rice vinegar, and brown sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Then whisk in the olive oil, sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Place the shrimp in the bowl with the marinade. Toss to coat with the marinade and chill until ready to cook.</p>
                <li>Toast the sesame seeds:</li>
                <p>Toast the sesame seeds in a small sauté pan on medium high heat until lightly browned.</p>
                <li>Stir-fry the shrimp and green onions:</li>
                <p>Heat cooking oil in a large stick-free sauté pan or wok (can use seasoned cast iron) on high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, almost smoking, use a slotted spoon to move the shrimp from the marinade into the hot pan. (Watch out, it will splatter.) Stir-fry for a minute.</p>
